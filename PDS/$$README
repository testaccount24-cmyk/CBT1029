Hi Sam,

I just want to share a small "toolbox" that I have been using for years.
The RXP was written in C language and has different actions :

- read/write sequential datasets with internal alloc/free
- read/write/update/delete VSAM records (KSDS/ESDS/RRDS)
- copy stem variables to stack and vice versa
- debug rexx variables allowing update of values

I have using this tool for internal procedures in my test and production
environment. Some features are insteresting and can be useful.

There are some examples in EXEC dataset.

Enjoy,
Daniel Gaeta
