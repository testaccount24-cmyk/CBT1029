//***FILE1029 is from Daniel Gaeta and contains a service package   *   FILE1029
//*           called RXP.  RXP performs EXECIO-like operations on   *   FILE1029
//*           data.  See member called $README (one "$") for some   *   FILE1029
//*           further explanation of how to use this package.       *   FILE1029
//*                                                                 *   FILE1029
//*           Source is currently not provided.  The executing      *   FILE1029
//*           code (from member - in XMIT-format) called LOAD       *   FILE1029
//*           is from C/370 language source.                        *   FILE1029
//*                                                                 *   FILE1029
//*           email:  Daniel Gaeta <dfgaeta@me.com>                 *   FILE1029
//*                                                                 *   FILE1029
//*           This package was shipped with an OFFLOAD-ed pds       *   FILE1029
//*           called EXEC.  I have expanded all the EXEC members,   *   FILE1029
//*           with ISPF-ID's given to them in the name of EXEC,     *   FILE1029
//*           so that one can see (a bit) more clearly, what the    *   FILE1029
//*           package can do.                                       *   FILE1029
//*                                                                 *   FILE1029
